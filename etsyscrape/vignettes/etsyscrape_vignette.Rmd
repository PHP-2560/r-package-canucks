## Etsy

“Etsy is the global marketplace for unique and creative goods. It’s home to a universe of special, extraordinary items, from unique handcrafted pieces to vintage treasures.” – Etsy.com

To view Etsy, visit <http://etsy.com>.

This package allows the user to scrape and explore the information returned by an Etsy online search. 

The etsyscrape package has 7 functions suited for this purpose: 

  * etsyURL()
  * etsyXML()
  * etsyItemResults()
  * etsyItemLinks()
  * etsyShopResults()
  * etsyShopLocations()
  * etsyShopReviews()

This document introduces you to etsyscrape’s basic set of tools and shows you how to apply them to scraped html data from Etsy.com search results. 

## Scraping Etsy.com Search Results: etsyURL() and etsyXML()

The etsyURL() and etsyXML() functions allow the user to scrape the results of an Etsy.com search.

In the example image below, the shopper is searching Etsy.com for “Christmas socks”. 
Etsy.com returns the following page to the shopper’s screen:

<br>

```{r, out.width = "1020px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("ChristmasSocksSearch.png")
```

<br>

### etsyURL()

There is a unique URL associated with the above search results. 

The etsyURL() function creates this URL without having to visit the Etsy website directly.

<br>

The etsyURL() function takes two arguments: the search string, and the desired ordering of the search results. The default order of the search results is by *relevancy*, with options for *newest*, *lowest price*, and *highest price* (see etsyURL() function documentation).

By simply entering the search string in the etsyURL() function, the corresponding URL is returned (with results ordered by most relevant).

<br>

In this "Christmas socks" example, the URL for the "Christmas socks" search is stored in the variable *socks_url*. 

The etsyscrape package is first loaded, the etsyURL() function creates the URL, and the print() statement allows us to view the result. 

<br>


```{r}
library(etsyscrape)

socks_url <- etsyURL("Christmas socks")
print(socks_url)
```

### etsyXML()

The etsyXML() function scrapes the html of the Etsy.com search results, using a provided URL.

In this example, the URL created by the “Christmas socks” Etsy.com search (*socks_url*) is used. 

The HTML obtained from scraping the URL is then stored in the variable *xml_results* as an XML document.

```{r}
xml_results <- etsyXML(socks_url)
print(xml_results)
```

## Extracting information from XML: etsyItem\*() and etsyShop\*() functions

The remaining functions allow the user to extract information from the scraped Etsy.com search results. 

### etsyItemResults()

The etsyItemResults() function provides the names of the items returned by an Etsy.com search. The function takes one argument: the scraped XML.

<br>

Following with the "Christmas socks" example, the item names are highlighted below:

```{r, out.width = "1020px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("ChristmasSocksItems.png")
```

<br>

The code below saves the character vector outputted by etsyItemResults() as *item_names*. Each element of the vector represents the name of one item. 

The head() function is used to display the first six items of the vector. 

*Note: The items in the vector do not always appear in the same order as they are displayed on-screen.*

```{r}
item_names <- etsyItemResults(xml_results)
head(item_names)
```

### etsyItemLinks()

The etsyItemLinks() function obtains the URL link to each unique item returned by an Etsy.com search. The function takes one argument: the scraped XML.

```{r}
item_links <- etsyItemLinks(xml_results)
head(item_links)
```

The first link in these results brings us to the individual item's Etsy page, as shown below. 

```{r, out.width = "1020px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("ChristmasSocksItem1.png")
knitr::include_graphics("ChristmasSocksItem1Page.png")
```



### etsyShopResults()

The etsyShopResults() function provides the names of the shops selling items returned by an Etsy.com search. The function takes one argument: the scraped XML.

<br>

Following with the "Christmas socks" example, the shop names are highlighted below:

```{r, out.width = "1020px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("ChristmasSocksShops.png")
```

<br>

The code below saves the character vector outputted by etsyShopResults() as *shop_names*. Each element of the vector represents the name of one shop. 

The head() function is used to display the first six shops of the vector. 

*Note: The items in the vector do not always appear in the same order as they are displayed on-screen. The shop names therefore may not be in order of appearance.*

```{r}
shop_names <- etsyShopResults(xml_results)
head(shop_names)
```

### etsyShopLocations()

The etsyShopLocations() function provides the location of each shop selling an item returned by an Etsy.com search. The function takes one argument: the scraped XML.

The function scrapes the location of the Etsy shop from the shop's homepage.

For the first item returned by our "Christmas socks" search, the shop selling the item is "PetPartyCo". Visiting the shop's webpage displays the screen below: 

```{r, out.width = "1020px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("ChristmasSocksItem1Shop.png")
```

<br>

The location returned is the location shown on the shop's webpage. 
The function returns a vector of shop names corresponding to the returned items.

```{r}
shop_locations <- etsyShopLocations(xml_results)
head(shop_locations)
```
